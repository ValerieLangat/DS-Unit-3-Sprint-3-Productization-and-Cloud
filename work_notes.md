What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
  The lecture was really informative and gave guidance on material to look
  further into after lecture. I was able to follow along during class without
  many hiccups which made completing the assignemt much easier.
What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
  I thought I would struggle a lot more than I did. Getting Flask going was fairly
  simple.
What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
  Probably just understading why certain errors were popping up in my command
  prompt.
